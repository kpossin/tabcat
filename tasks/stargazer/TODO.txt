- comets as they are now can be hit by hovering finger in the middle of the screen - is there a way for the comets to not always go through the center, so that there is more effort to hit in different places? I know that comet A is always a set speed. Perhaps instead of each comet being a set speed, they should be on the screen for a set period of time. This way if the comet goes vertically rather than diagonally the subject will have just as much time to touch it.
- we may want to have a practice trial with 2 stars and make sure it is clear that they only need to find one of the stars. For example, the trial with 2 stars could say "Remember both stars" and then at the probe it could say the same thing as with the prior practice "Whiceh star did you just see?" We may need to have at least 1 single star and at least 2 double star practice trials, with more at each level if subjects are having trouble. Let me know if we should discuss the specifics.
